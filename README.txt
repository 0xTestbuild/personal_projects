Hi there! I use this repository to create small, simple projects to help build my programming skills. I am still a novice, self-taught programmer, but, mock my words, I will one day be a ninja!

Projects: 

1) Calculator(Completed) 

	Simple calculator app that performs the 4 main mathematical opeerations. 

2) File De(compressor) (In Progress...)

	Simple file compressor and decompressor application.

3) Auto-Crack Wifi (To be started soon!)

	To be used in conjuction with Kali Linux's reaver and airmon-ng applications to automate wifi password cracking without having to lookup/memorize commands, copy/paste addresses, or open multiple terminal windows.
